I am a PhD student at the Informatics Institute of the University of Amsterdam supervised by [Efstratios Gavves](https://www.egavves.com). I studied Physics at the University of Turin where I graduated cum laude and Physics at the Imperial College where I graduated with first class honours. My research focuses on the intersection of Dynamical systems and Deep Learning. My interests also lie in applied Geometry for computer vision and representation learning.

*Introducing the novel architecture of time-reversible symplectic neural networks for learning dynamics of physical systems* **(oral)**

Riccardo Valperga, Kevin Webster, Dmitry Turaev, Victoria Klein, Jeroen Lamb Proceedings of The 4th Annual Learning for Dynamics and Control Conference, PMLR 168:906-916, 2022.



* ## [Learning Lie Group Symmetry Transformations with Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01583)

*In this work we focus on discovering and characterising unknown symmetries present in a dataset, in particular, Lie group symmetry transformations beyond the traditional ones usually considered in the field.*

* ## [Geometric Contrastive Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=cE4BY5XrzR)

*In this work, we propose making use of geodesic distances on the hypersphere to learn better contrasts between representations.* **(oral)**

* ## [Neural Modulation Fields for Conditional Cone Beam Neural Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08351)

*We propose a novel conditioning method where local modulations are modeled per patient as a field over the input domain through a Neural Modulation Field (NMF).*
