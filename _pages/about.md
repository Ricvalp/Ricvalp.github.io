I am a PhD student at the Informatics Institute of the University of Amsterdam supervised by [Efstratios Gavves](https://www.egavves.com). I studied Physics at the University of Turin where I graduated cum laude and Physics at the Imperial College where I graduated with first class honours. My research focuses on the intersection of Dynamical systems and Deep Learning. My interests also lie in applied Geometry for computer vision and representation learning. I am currently doing a research internship at [ServiceNow](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Element+ai&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) where I am working on causal discovery from time series.
