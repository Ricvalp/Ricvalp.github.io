*Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have become popular in statistics as versatile techniques to sam- ple from complicated probability distributions. In this work, we propose a method to parameter- ize and train transition kernels of Markov chains to achieve efficient sampling and good mixing. This training procedure minimizes the total vari- ation distance between the stationary distribu- tion of the chain and the empirical distribution of the data. Our approach leverages involutive Metropolis-Hastings kernels constructed from re- versible neural networks that ensure detailed bal- ance by construction. We find that reversibility also implies C2-equivariance of the discriminator function which can be used to restrict its function space.*
